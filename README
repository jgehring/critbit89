critbit89 - A crit-bit tree implementation for strings in C89
=============================================================

This implementation closely follows the original CWEB source by Dan
Bernstein [http://cr.yp.to/critbit.html], provided as generated C
code at [https://github.com/agl/critbit]. It was converted to
human-readable C89 code, and should be more portable than the
original version. Additionally, support for custom memory allocators
has been added.

Hereby placed under public domain, just like Dan Bernstein's original
implementation.
